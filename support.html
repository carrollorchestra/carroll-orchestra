      <h2>How can you support the student musicians of Carroll Chamber Orchestra?</h2>
      <p>
        The easiest way that anyone can support CCO is by spreading the word.
        Raising public awareness of our goals and programs is crucial. More specifically,
        here are some items to consider:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "students">
      <h3>Students: </h3>
      <p>In addition to getting the word out about CCO, student musicians can join
        the performing groups and all students can help run the organization. If you
        are interested in joining the group, sign up for our Remind by texting @9kk8f8 to the number 810-10.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "parents">
      <h3>Parents: </h3>
      <p>A great way to support CCO is to join the Parent’s Guild,
        a monthly meeting of parents who are interested in supporting
        student music and advancing the goals of the organization.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "teachers">
      <h3>Teachers: </h3>
      <p>Encourage your students and their parents to appreciate the value of the arts by supporting our school’s music and arts groups. </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "district-staff">
      <h3>District Staff: </h3>
